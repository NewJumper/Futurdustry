A Mindustry mod, under construction

Mod Content:
-
The Futurdustry mod includes and features 6 new materials, 2 maps, several machinery, and a new drill and conveyor. Futurdustry brings these six items into the game: blast steel, glass, hematite, magnesium, sermium, and steel. Some of these items can be collected from the two new zones or from production through new machinery.
Discover such machinery by starting off on Volcanic Disruption. You'll need to head in strong and with high tier materials in order to mine magnesium and hematite. These two minerals will help build up better, stronger defenses against the **REDACTED**.
~ add some more stuff idk ~

Good luck player.
